### [US high-tech feels the pain of tariffs on Chinese exports](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/24/WS5d100175a3103dbf14329bf5.html)

True, the United States boasts advantages in the electronics industry. But most of its star companies' mainstream products are made in China, which is the world's largest market of these products as well.

US electronics companies started coming to China in the early 1990s, and have made it a center of the industry's supply chain, as well as the most important manufacturing center, which has helped them lower their costs, and contributed to the popularization of electronic gadgets. 

If the US imposes a 25 percent tariff on the remaining $320 billion worth of imports from China, as it has threatened, it will put all of the electronic products manufactured by the US companies in China in the cross hairs, as well as many other commodities that US companies make in China for US consumers.（好长的一句话o(╥﹏╥)o）

Since China's Huawei and other major Chinese companies in the industry do not sell their products in the US, thanks in part to the US administration's obstruction, the tariffs will not directly hurt the Chinese enterprises that Washington regards as a thorn in its side.

More importantly, the aforementioned US companies will not be able to find substitutes for China on their supply chain maps, as China's strengths as a core part of the supply chain have been accumulated over nearly 20 years.

Staying in China puts them close to the forefront of the development and application of the next-generation telecommunications technology. 

### [Education must cross the divide](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/26/WS5d12ad5ba3103dbf1432a371.html)

WU YISHU, a high school graduate in Shanghai famous for becoming the champion at the 2017 Chinese Poetry Conference, made a buzz again because she got 613 points out of a possible 660 in this year's annual national college entrance exam.（才女武艺姝，୧(๑•̀◡•́๑)૭） 

It seems many people are still trapped in the rigid thinking that divides knowledge into science and arts. 

For a long time, domestic high schools have divided their students into arts or science classes, where they receive totally different kinds of education, take different tests in the national college entrance examination, or gaokao, and attend different majors upon entering university, where they will hardly receive any education in the other discipline.（要是不分科怎么培养专业性人才？）

About four years ago, a quite famous news anchor was even reported as not knowing that the chemical formula for edible salt is NaCl, which prompted a lot of jokes from science students on social media.

From the latter half of the year, the majority of high school students nationwide will receive comprehensive education that comprises both arts and science courses in a balanced manner.（这样高考是不是更难了Σ(⊙▽⊙"a）

The wisdom of ancient Chinese stretches across the ages and is echoed by the modern concept of general education.

### [Should museums be free?](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201905/18/WS5cdf50dda3104842260bc5f0.html)

Museums are not only there for enjoyment; they are education, and as such should be free. 

The Met in NYC is technically free; they ask you to give what you can afford. But the idea of a person or child interested in art not being able to view it because of cost is morally wrong.

Free entrance does not attract people, nor does it encourage them to appreciate it.

A better option is to charge fees for regular visitors but provide free tickets as prizes for high-achieving students and others who are likely to appreciate the reward.（有毒吧）

For purely selfish reasons, corporations and businessmen should strive to support museums and other cultural destinations, in hopes that generations of future workers are more creative and able to do good work.

I think art exhibits should be free to the public. I do, however, think twice a year the museums should host a fundraising event to help pay for the cost of upkeep.

They do it all the time. Wealthy buyers pay $100 for a plate and the proceeds are given to the museum. If you decide you want to buy the art, the proceeds should go to the artist, with a fee going to the museum.
