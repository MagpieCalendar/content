### [Social reasons for baby boy bias must be eliminated](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/20/WS5d0ad175a3103dbf14329385.html)

STATISTICS FROM THE HEILONGJIANG provincial bureau of statistics indicate that the gender ratio at birth last year in some of its counties was far beyond the 107:100 upper limit of the normal range. 

The unbalanced sex ratio at birth in Tongjiang, which cannot be justified by any natural causes, should have rung alarm bells, as such a wide gender gap will necessarily sow the seeds for a range of difficult social issues in the foreseeable future.

When discrimination against females, abuse of fetal sex diagnosis, which has long been outlawed, and abortions come together, the gender gap is not that hard to understand.

It is necessary to criminalize the doctors profiting from the unlawful practice that has prompted many couples to choose abortion to avoid having a daughter. Those who desert babies or commit infanticide must be punished with due severity, otherwise, more will be encouraged to do the same.

There is still a long way to go for the country to fully protect women's and children's rights, and root out the gender discrimination that has remained ingrained deeply in the social and cultural soil.

### [Innovation should be cooperative, not isolated pursuit](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/20/WS5d0b8d97a3103dbf143295f7.html)

Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei, recently met with two US scholars, George Gilder and Nicholas Negroponte, for talks over afternoon tea in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in which he stressed how openness and cooperation, not isolation and confrontation, can promote human welfare and progress. 

In the industrial age, each country could make their own sewing machines, tractors and other industrial products. But in the information era, it is impossible for a country to make one thing by itself. Therefore, countries must cooperate. Only through cooperation can we meet the needs of human civilization and enable more people to enjoy the benefits of new technologies at a lower cost.（age还可以这样用？）

I have never appreciated the term "independent innovation", because I believe that science and technology are the common wealth of all humanity and we must step on the shoulders of our predecessors to shorten our gap with the world's leading level. 

Except maybe farmers, no one believes he can do everything by himself. I support independent innovation on the spiritual level. That is to say, when other people innovate something, we should respect their intellectual property and get their permission for their use after paying appropriate fees.

Some people advocate the law of the jungle and excessively emphasize competition. However, the law of the jungle does not fully apply to human society, and in most cases and most of the time, the problem facing human beings is not "your death, my survival", but coexistence.

### [Women's national soccer team gives men's a lesson in professionalism](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/21/WS5d0c22b6a3103dbf143296b2.html)

 In the next round later this week, the Chinese team is likely to encounter England or Italy, either of which will be tough to beat. But most Chinese fans believe the team still has a chance to make its way to the quarterfinal.

In another development, fortune smiled on the Chinese men's national soccer team, which relies heavily on naturalized players, when it was recognized by the Asian Football Association on Monday as the last of the eight seeded teams, nosing out Iraq by a narrow margin, in the qualifiers of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which means China will steer clear of the stronger teams.(这句话怎么可以这么长)

Obviously, the influx of hot money to the men's soccer circle has, instead of promoting the rise of the sport, distorted some basic laws of it, as the club owners aspire for quick success through buying star players, and the national manager hopes for the same using naturalized foreign players. Both ignore youth training.

By contrast, women's soccer has largely inherited the training system dating back to the planned economy age. (计划经济是什么鬼(・◇・)？)

Money talks.(有钱能使鬼推磨，ᕙ༼ ͝°益° ༽ᕗ)

### [How do you view the debate between Trish Regan and Liu Xin?](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/01/WS5cf1c12ca3104842260bef69.html)

CGTN anchor Liu Xin joined Fox Business Network host Trish Regan on her prime-time show for a live television discussion on China-US trade issues. It is the first time that television hosts from China and the US have faced off live. 

Actually it is not a debate, it is more a discussion.

But when she realized that there will be a billion eyes watching her, she must form a better research team with funds from the company, because there are also as many American people waiting to see a comedy to be staged by the politicians they do not like.(你猜猜这里的she是谁)

It's a net win for both sides because the actual content of the debate is irrelevant. Both sides can point to particular moments as "wins" or "losses". But neither side will agree on what those are or how significant they are and it won't matter to your final opinion.

Calmness wins the day.

However, since US media rarely broadcast China's perspective on the trade war and related issues, this debate was still very helpful.

Topics were quickly changed and not deep enough. Trish kept asking Liu Xin plenty of questions and ended the debate with not even a chance for Liu to ask a single question, which is unfair to Liu.

Your confidence and professional speaking skills perfectly show the real characteristics of modern well-educated Chinese people and **will completely change some narrow-minded or arrogant foreigners' stereotypes about China or Asia and even the world.**
